#other for Valentine's Day? Let's right some code to generate
#a gift recommendation!
#
#The variables above give the length of the relationship in
#number of years, months, and days. Add some code below to
#print a gift recommendation based on these values:
#
# - If you've been dating for at least 4 years, give them a
#   dog ("dog").
# - If you've been dating for at least 1 year but less than
#   4 years, give them a watch ("watch").
# - If you've been dating for at least 6 months but less than
#   1 year, give them concert tickets ("concert tickets").
# - If you've been dating for at least a day but less than 6
#   months, give them candy ("candy").
# - If aren't actually dating, go big or go home: give them
#   a yacht to sail away together ("yacht").
#
#Note that no matter what, you should only print one gift.


#Add your code here!

#Around Georgia Tech, there are plenty of places to get a
#late night bite to eat. However, they have different hours,
#so when choosing where to go, you have to think about who's
#still open!
#
#Imagine you're choosing between the following restaurants:
#
# - Barrelhouse: Closes at 11:00PM
# - Taco Bell: Closes at 2:00AM
# - Cookout: Closes at 3:00AM
# - Waffle House: Never closes. Ever.
#
#Assume that this list is also a priority list: if Barrelhouse
#is open, you choose Barrelhouse. If not, you choose Taco Bell
#if it's open. If not, you choose Cookout if it's open. If
#not, you choose Waffle House.
#
#However, there are two wrinkles:
#
# - We're using 12-hour time.
# - hour will always represent a time from 10PM to 5AM.
#
#That means that if hour is 10 or 11, it's PM; if hour is
#12, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, it's AM. This will make your reasoning
#a little more complex. You may assume that all four
#restaurants open later than 6AM, though, so you don't have
#to worry about opening time, just closing time.
#
#Add some code below that will print what restaurant you'll
#go to based on the current values of hour and minute.


#Add your code here!

hour_TB = [11, 12, 1]

if hour == 10:
    print("Barrelhouse")
elif hour in hour_TB:
    print("Taco Bell")
elif hour == 2:

#The United States has a movie rating system that rates
#movies with one of five ratings: G, PG, PG-13, R, and NC-17.
#Although some of the ratings are not binding, imagine that
#you are a parent who decides on the following rules:
#
# - Any child can see a G-rated movie.
# - To see a PG-rated movie, your child must be 8 or older.
# - To see a PG-13-rated movie, your child must be 13 or older.
# - To see an R-rated movie, your child must be 17 or older.
# - Your child may never see an NC-17 movie.
#
#The variables above give a rating and a child's age. Use
#these variables to select and print one of these two
#messages based on the criteria above:
#
# - "You may see that movie!"
# - "You may not see that movie!"
#
#However, there's one trick: you may not use the 'and' operator
#anywhere in this code!


#Add your code here!

elif rating == "R":
    if age >= 17:

        print("You may not see that movie!")
