#Create four variables name my_integer, my_decimal,
#my_string, and my_boolean. Assign to each variable a
#value of the corresponding type (an integer for
#my_integer, a string of characters for my_string,
#etc.). You can choose whatever values you want --
#just make sure the variable names and types are
#correct!
#
#Then, print the types of each of the four variables
#in order: first the integer, then the decimal
#number, then the string, then the boolean. This
#should print text like <class 'int'>, <class
#'float'>, and so on.
#
#Don't print anything except their types!


#Create your variables here!
my_integer = 1

#Print their types here!

#The code below creates a variable named my_int and
#assigns to it a random number from 0 to 10. You
#don't need to worry about how this works; all you
#need to know is that my_int will have an integer
#as its value once this code is done.

import random
my_int = random.randint(0, 10)

#Do not edit the code above!
#
#The line below attempts to print the value of
#my_int, but currently it does not work. Fix
#this code so that it works and prints "The
#current value of my_int is:", followed by the
#value.

print("The current value of my_int is: " + str(my_int))

#In the code below, we've created two dates. The day in each
#date is chosen randomly. You don't need to worry about how
#this works; all you need to know is that when you start
#writing your code, you'll have access to two variables, each
#holding a date: earlier_date and later_date, and later_date
#is guaranteed to be later than earlier_date.
#
#Complete this code so that it creates a variable called
#days_between that stores the number of days between the two
#dates.
#
#Hint: You can find the number of days between two dates by
#subtracting the day number of the earlier date from the
#day number of the later date.

from datetime import date
import random
earlier_date = date(2017, 6, random.randint(1, 25))
later_date = date(2017, 6, random.randint(earlier_date.day + 1, 28))

#Do not modify the code above!


#Write your code here!
days_between = later_date.day - earlier_date.day

#If your code is working correctly, then the following line
#of code will print the correct number of dayes between the
#two dates. Notice that this line uses commas instead of plus
#signs, which is why it doesn't have to convert the dates to
#strings: Python does that implicitly when we use this syntax.
print("There are", days_between, "days between", earlier_date, "and", later_date)

my_int1 = 1
my_int2 = 5
my_int3 = 9

#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.
#
#The code above creates three variables: my_int1, my_int2,
#and my_int3. Each will always be an integer
#
#Now, add three lines of code that will print the values
#of those three variables with "my_int1:", "my_int2:", and
#"my_int3:" labeling the output. So, if the variables' values
#were 1, 5, and 9, your lines would print:
#
#my_int1: 1
#my_int2: 5
#my_int3: 9


#Add your lines of code here!
print("my_int1:" , my_int1)
print("my_int2:" , my_int2)
print("my_int3:" , my_int3)

#Next, these lines of code will modify the values of those
#three variables. You don't need to worry about how these
#work. We'll talk about it in the next couple chapters.

my_int1 += 5
my_int2 *= 3
my_int3 **= 2

#Now, copy and paste the same lines from above into the lines
#below. This way, your output will show you the new values of
#these variables.


#Add your lines of code here!
print("my_int1:" , my_int1)
print("my_int2:" , my_int2)
print("my_int3:" , my_int3)


#If your code works correctly, then when run, it should print:
#my_int1: 1
#my_int2: 5
#my_int3: 9
#my_int1: 6
#my_int2: 15
#my_int3: 81
#
#This should be the output when Running. When Submitting,
#we'll test your code with other values of these three
#variables.
